          <h1>Behaviour</h1>
            <p>Morkies have big personalities tied in them. As happy and playful as they are sweet and affectionate, they might look like cuddly little toys, but don't let their size or fluffiness fool you. Their terrier heritage gives Morkies a lot of energy and fearless spunk. They love to run and play, and they're always up for a game of fetch or chase. But despite their energy, they're also content to cuddle and curl up in your lap. But the terrier in Morkies also gives them a stubborn streak that can make them a handful, especially for inexperienced dog parents, says Dogtime. Morkie puppies who receive early socialization and obedience training generally grow up to be calmer, more obedient and more likely to get along well with other pets. Otherwise, Morkies might do better as only pets. They always need a firm but patient leader to keep them from running the show.</p>
            <p>While Morkies love to play with older children and can get along well with everyone in the household, they tend to form strong attachments to a "favorite" family member, which makes them great dogs for singles and couples. Because of their small size, Morkies are more fragile than they realize, and as such, they aren't usually a good fit for families with small children. For safety's sake, these tiny dogs should never be allowed to play with very young children or larger dogs without very close supervision.</p>
            <p>It's also important to train Morkies from an early age to tolerate being left alone. These are highly social dogs who hate to be on their own and can be prone to developing separation anxiety. Through a combination of training, plenty of exercise and toys to provide distraction and mental stimulation, Morkies can adapt to being left for a few hours at a time. Even so, they do best in households where at least one family member is home the majority of the time.</p>
