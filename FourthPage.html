          <p>Keep in mind that as a hybrid breed, there can always be variations in the Morkie size and appearance. However, like both the Maltese and the Yorkshire terrier, the Morkie is a small dog who generally weighs around 5–7 pounds and measures anywhere from 7–9 inches tall.</p>
          <p>Morkies tend to get their coloring from their Yorkshire terrier parent. They can be black, brown, white, or even golden. Their coats tend to be long, though many Morkie owners keep their dogs clipped short, and their ears can be either pointed like a Yorkie or floppy like a Maltese</p>
          <p>Morkies have small, bright, dark eyes that sparkle with inquisitiveness (especially if you happen to be holding something tasty) and little black gumdrop noses. They're adorable—and they know it.</p>
