            <p>People love the Yorkshire terrier, and they love the Maltese, so it's only natural they would want to combine the two for a mixed breed that has the fluff and sweetness of a Maltese and the verve and coloring of a Yorkie. Universe, meet the Morkie.</p>
            <p>Like their parent breeds, Morkies are small, energetic toy dogs who love their families. Because they can be vocal about unfamiliar people, they also make good alarm systems, alerting their owners to someone walking up to the door with a sharp bark. Caring for a Morkie is pretty straightforward: Consistent, positive reinforcement training, a moderate amount of regular exercise, and regular grooming. The Morkie coat, while typically long, is often kept in a short puppy cut. Morkies are low-shedding and considered to be a low-allergen dog. And while no dog is truly hypoallergenic, Morkies can be a good fit for those who tend to sniffle around puppies.</p>
            <p>Though they're sometimes compared to the Maltipoo, which is a poodle and Maltese mix, there are a couple of key differences between these two hybrids: Maltipoos are generally a little larger than Morkies and will also have a curlier coat, thanks to their poodle parent.</p>
